# Palindrome Checker

This is a simple algorithm to check if a given word is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/elamuhombe/gomycode-recursion-checkpoint.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd gomycode-recursion-checkpoint
    ```

3. **Run the Algorithm:**
    - Make sure you have a Pascal compiler installed.
    - Open the main program file in your compiler.
    - Compile and run the program.

4. **Enter a Word:**
    - When prompted, enter a word that you want to check for palindrome.

5. **View the Result:**
    - The program will output whether the entered word is a palindrome or not.

## Algorithm Details

The algorithm is implemented in a Pascal-like syntax and follows these steps:

1. Declare variables to store the input word and track length and indices.
2. Read the input word from the user.
3. Check the base case: If the length of the word is less than or equal to 1, it is considered a palindrome.
4. If the word has more than one character, the algorithm checks if characters at symmetric positions are equal.
5. If all symmetric characters are equal, the word is considered a palindrome.
6. Output the result.

## Example

For example, if you run the program and enter the word "level," the program will output that it is a palindrome.
